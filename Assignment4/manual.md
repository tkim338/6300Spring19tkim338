GUI shows three text input files with corresponding labels: `<message>`, `<shift by>`, and `<rotate by>`.  
`<message>` takes any text input and shows an error message if the input is blank or contains no letters.
`<shift by>` takes any positive number input and shows an error if the input is greater than 50.  The field will prevent you from entering negative values.
`<rotate by>` takes any positive number input.  An error will show here (and in `<shift by>`) if both numeric inputs are blank or zero.
